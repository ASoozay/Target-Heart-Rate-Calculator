Version 4 is here, and its basically exactly the same as Version 3! But now, it has the package at the top. The rest of the code is the same as in Version 3, so for simplicity, here is the notes for version 3:

More updates are here to Target Heart Rate Calculator, now with a new feature! If Mr. Criss is reading this, this Version  has an extra feature, saveInfo. Version 2 has no extra features, and is the base assignment

PatientPortal.java: 
- new method: saveInfo(extra feature)
- saveInfo prints the patient's info to a .txt file, so their information is not lost after the program ends
- Users can now add as many patient's as they like! When a patient's information is added and printed, the user can type "Yes" to add more patients, and "No" to exit the program
- Maximum Heart Rate is now added to the information that is printed to the terminal, inside of printInfo.

HeartRates.java:
- targetHeartRate now only has the 50% and 85% heart rate values in its returned String, removing the "Target Heart Rate". So, "Target Heart Rate" is no longer mistakenly printed twice during printInfo.

  That's all for now!
