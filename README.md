Significant tweaks to HeartRates class. methods for calculateAge, calculateMaximumHeartRate, and targetHeartRate no longer require paramters, making it much easier to use in the main method. As a result, the main method and patientInfo are also much clearer. A new method is added for PatientPortal printPatientInfo which is now called directly in main instead of within patientInfo, improving clarity and readability.
